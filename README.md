# Guide-Bot

- For the ''Build for Digital India'' program, we decided to build a guide-bot for Regional Transport Office (RTO), Government of India under the theme Smart cities & Infrastructure.  A guide-bot can answer and help the people for relevant kind of queries and confusions usually they have. So work of people will become more easier and correct information can be provided.

- The system is built with the help of Python language, Django Framework, Deep Neural Network (DNN),  various libraries like TensorFlow, nltk,speech-recognition,sox, tflearn, etc and self-made training data set.
